# Human Force Data

First plug in one force sensor, and run the executable in optoforcesensors/sensor1/build.

Plug in the next sensor and run the executable in optoforcesensors/sensor2/build.

Run the executable in optitrack/bin.

The force sensor executables may need to be run several times, until they find the connected force sensors.  If running on Linux, you will likely need to run them with sudo.
